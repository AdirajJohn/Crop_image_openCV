# YOLOv8_ObjectDetection

## I developed a custom object detection model to automate and enhance the precision and efficiency of cropping thousands of images, ultimately saving hours of manual labor.

## After loading the pretrained YOLOv8 model, i conducted additional training and validation with the custom dataset, achieving an impressive training accuracy of approximately 98%.

## The model accurately placed bounding boxes on the regions to be cropped in unseen images and efficiently saved the cropped images using the 'save_crop=True' hyperparameter.
